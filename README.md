# Coursera---IBM-Capstone-1
This is the repository for my final project, the Capstone assignment for Course #9 in the IBM-Coursera Professional Data Science Specialization.
It represents the culmination of 9 months of learning and practice... which have been a joy to me, despite the frustration of trying to figure out why my code didn't run, only to learn that there *was* a reason, that it made sense, and when I corrected it, everything worked like a charm.
